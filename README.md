# NodeJS Instagram App
_by Gary Pang, "CodeWritingCow"_

This is a Node app for accessing the Instagram API and fetching the most popular photos. From the free [Scotch.io](https://scotch.io) eBook, "Building Your First Node Application."

I'm adding new features, such as routes to images of sushi and ramen, and my Instagram account, [pangofhunger](https://www.instagram.com/pangofhunger/).
